            <h2>Short Bio</h2>
            <p>I am a senior at Boston University studying computer science and business 
                administration and I grew up in Foster City, California (suburb of San Francisco).
                I'm especially interested in full stack engineering and machine learning and 
                am getting hands on experience with both through internships and research. In my
                free time, I love being outdoors and enjoy camping, canoeing, and hiking!

                            I greatly enjoy camping in my free time! I have been camping with my Boy
                        Scout troop for many years and have camped all across California, in several
                        other states (Nevada, Idaho, Utah) and even in France!

                            I really enjoy any paddle boating activities including canoeing, kayaking,
                        and whitewater rafting! I have done short, flatwater canoe trips and also 
                        50 mile river runs in canoes. I've done whitewater river runs in both kayaks 
                        and rafts which has been super fun!

                            Continuing with the theme of the outdoors, I greatly enjoy hiking in the 
                        woods with friends! I love escaping urban environments to spend more time 
                        in nature. I find hiking as a fun and cheap way to get outdoors and exercise 
                        with friends.
