            <h2>Short Bio</h2>
            <p>I am a senior at Boston University studying computer science and business 
                administration and I grew up in Foster City, California (suburb of San Francisco).
                I'm especially interested in full stack engineering and machine learning and 
                am getting hands on experience with both through internships and research. In my
                free time, I love being outdoors and enjoy camping, canoeing, and hiking!
